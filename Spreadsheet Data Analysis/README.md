# Manhattan Vacation Rental Market Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
As part of a strategic investment consultancy, I analyzed the Manhattan Airbnb market to provide data-driven recommendations for property investors. The goal was to identify high-performing neighborhoods and property types that offer the best return on investment for vacation rentals.

## 🎯 Key Research Questions
To guide the investment strategy, this analysis answers the following:
1.  **Market Attractiveness:** Which neighborhoods and property sizes (number of bedrooms) show the highest demand and performance?
2.  **Revenue Potential:** How much annual/monthly revenue did these specific listings generate?

## 🛠️ Methodology & Data Governance
Following best practices for data integrity, this project involved:
* **Raw Data Preservation:** A master copy of the original dataset was maintained to ensure a "single source of truth."
* **Data Cleaning Documentation:** A dedicated log of all cleaning steps (handling missing values, formatting price data, and removing outliers) was recorded to ensure reproducibility.
* **Pivot Table Analysis:** Utilized advanced pivot tables to aggregate pricing trends across different zip codes and bedroom counts.

## 📊 Analysis Components
The analysis is structured into the following segments:
* **Neighborhood Comparison:** A breakdown of average daily rates (ADR) and occupancy trends across Manhattan districts.
* **Property Size Optimization:** Comparative revenue analysis for studios vs. multi-bedroom units.
* **Financial Summary:** Estimates of gross revenue generated by top-performing listings.

## 📁 Project Structure
