# NYC Air Quality Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the intersection of air quality, urban density, and public health across New York City. The goal was to transform complex environmental datasets into a compelling visual narrative that highlights issues of **environmental equity**.

The resulting dashboard serves as a tool for advocates and policymakers to identify neighborhoods in need of targeted environmental interventions.

## 📊 Key Insights & Features
Our analysis focused on several critical dimensions of urban air quality:

* **Borough-Level Disparities:** We identified persistent differences in air quality across the five boroughs. Areas with higher population density and limited green space—specifically the **Bronx and Manhattan**—consistently experience poorer air quality metrics.
* **Public Health Correlation:** The data revealed a strong correlation between pollution spikes and increases in **asthma-related emergency room visits**, emphasizing the immediate human cost of poor air quality.
* **Actionable Visualizations:** The dashboard makes a data-driven case for localized interventions to improve air quality in the city's most vulnerable neighborhoods.

## 🛠️ Skills Developed
Through this intensive project, I strengthened my expertise in the following areas:
* **Data Storytelling & Visualization:** Turning raw numbers into a narrative for public health advocacy.
* **Time-Series Analysis:** Tracking pollution trends and health outcomes over specific intervals.
* **Environmental Data Analysis:** Working with specialized datasets related to urban ecology.
* **Cross-Functional Teamwork:** Collaborating under tight deadlines to solve complex data problems.

## 💡 Reflections
My favorite part of this project was the collaborative problem-solving required to synthesize a massive dataset into actionable insights within a short timeframe. It was incredibly rewarding to bridge the gap between "big data" and real-world public health implications.
